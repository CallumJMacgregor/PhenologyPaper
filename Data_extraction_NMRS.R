# we have moth data from two sources - NMRS and RIS
# we are going to use these data to estimate changes in a range of variables between two time windows:

# used in the original Mair et al. paper...

# distribution (percentage change in occupied hectads per year)
# abundance (percentage change in abundance index per year)

# dispersal ability? very tricky to replicate for moths... so maybe just use butterflies for this paper?
# habitat availability? suggest talk to Phil about using SSI for this... he has less faith in SSI for moths so again a case for just using butterflies?
#  - could either use national SSI (easier to extract)
#  - or try to replicate Mair more exactly by focussing it on colonised hectads!


# added in for this paper...

# phenology (number of days change in first-generation emergence date per year)
# northern range margin (km advance per year)


## selecting data to use
# we have different criteria for inclusion in the study for each data type 
# (NMRS = hectad-level annual presence/absence; RIS = site-level daily count data)

# we need to apply these to select out species to use from the hectad data, and species/site combinations to use from the site data
